(G)    D          C     G
In the town where I was born
Em      Am       C        D
Lived a man who sailed to sea
G      D       C      G
And he told us of his life
Em     Am      C    D
In the land of submarines
 
G     D         C      G
So we sailed up to the sun
Em      Am        C      D
Till we found the sea of green
G      D       C         G
And we lived beneath the waves
Em     Am     C    D
In our yellow submarine
